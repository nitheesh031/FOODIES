        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            A mission statement explains why your business exists. Therefore, a restaurant mission statement explains why your restaurant exists. Your mission statement should explain what purpose your restaurant serves.  It should also match your brand voice and aesthetic, and align well with any restaurant slogans or taglines that you use.

Mission statements originally come from the nonprofit world. For instance, in the U.S., nonprofit organizations must have a mission statement that guides everything they do. For-profit businesses have adopted the practice of creating a mission to create a stronger sense of business focus and brand alignment.

Mission statements are often matched with company values and/or a vision. Together, a mission, vision, and values describe what your restaurant stands for. In other words, they collectively serve as a compass for your business, guiding you towards your north star â€“ the goals that you hope to achieve through your restaurant.
